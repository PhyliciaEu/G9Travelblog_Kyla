“Yong” means “pouring out” and “quan” means “spring” in Chinese. Yongquan Temple 
(涌泉寺) gets its name because there is a spring pouring out in front of it. Being 
“One of The Most Sacred Temples in Fujian”, Yongquan Temple is usually a must-visit. 
The temple is located at the western side of the large Gushan (Drum Mountain) Scenic Area. 
Visitors heading to Yongquna Temple will also enjoy hiking or biking in Gushan Scenic Area.
