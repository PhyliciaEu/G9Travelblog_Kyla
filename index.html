<p>Welcome to Kyla's Fuzhou travel blog. Use the navigation bar to explore more!<br>
<br>
Fuzhou (abbreviated as “榕”), the capital and transportation hub of Fujian Province, is a coastal city in the southeastern China. It faces China’s Taiwan Island across the East China Sea.<br>

Fuzhou remains largely undiscovered and seriously underrated by Western travelers, but those taking a tour here are in for a real treat. With a long history of over 2,000 years, Fuzhou is a national historical and cultural city. It was once the<br> 
gateway of Ancient Maritime Silk Road and one of the firstly opened coastal cities in China. Historical sites, ancient dwellings, mottled alleys and centuries-old temples are scattered everywhere in the city. Besides, thanks to its unbeatable<br> 
location of settling along the coastline of China, Fuzhou also welcomes the worldwide visitors with its delicious seafood and stunning islands and beaches.
